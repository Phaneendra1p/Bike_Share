# Bike_Share
In this project I have analyzed the bike riding characteristics of casual and subscribers(members) of a bike share company located in Chicago. I have used the public data availbe to everyone of the year 2021.By analysing the different patterns of users I was able to provide data driven solutions to convert casual riders to members of the company.
